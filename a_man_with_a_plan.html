                            Unsatisfied with the current state of affairs in the game AI development, brave Code Sorcerers have
                            embarked on a quest to explore ins and outs of creating intelligent NPCs in the land of a yet-non-existent text-based role-playing
                            game.
                        </p>

                <p>How is our RPG going to look like? Assume it shows some situation to the player
                    and she must choose what to do from a fixed list of choices. When she does -
                    the game calculates what happens and shows the next situation and choices. Since we want our game world to be
                    inhabited by intelligent NPCs, they must be able to do the same: choose an <em>action</em>                    
                    from the set of actions given a situation - <em>a state</em>. We want our NPCs to do complex things like
                    going to work, buying, cooking and eating food, even investigating a crime (if an NPC works for the police).
                    How are they supposed to choose actions to achieve that?</p>

                <p>There are many approaches to this in the literature, but how would the human player do it?
                    Usually, a human wants to achieve some high-level
                    <em>goal</em> like "Make a breakfast" and constructs a complex plan of actions given all he knows 
                    ("eggs are in the fridge, the fridge is in the kitchen: go
                    to the kitchen and open the fridge etc."). Setting aside the problem of high-level goal selection 
                    (we're going to return to it later) we can try to imitate this.</p>

                <p class="lead">Planning with <em>a state</em>, <em>a goal</em> and a set of <em>actions</em> seems to be a good bet - we could
                    craft a detailed, believable world where NPCs would interact with it pursuing their goals.

                            We're going to use JavaScript for code samples. Sorceries can be cast in any language, but only with JS we can do it right in the browser.

                <h5>The first challenge</h5>
                <p>Consider a humble task of fetching yourself a cup of milk. A possible plan goes like this: open the cupboard, put a cup on the table,
                    open the fridge, put a carton of milk on the table, pour milk into the cup. Our NPC Vasiliy
                    should be able to do at least that. Or else he would die in our harsh world - a small town in the
                    northern Soviet Russia (you can already tell I dislike generic fantasy). The environment - a kitchen
                    - includes a starting state
                    <em>init</em>, a function that returns <em>actions available</em> in a state and a function that returns
                    the result of an action in a state - a <em>transition</em> function. </p>
                <textarea id="code1"></textarea>
                <div class="btn-group" role="group" style="margin: 2px 0px 0px 30px">
                    <button type="button" class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" id="runCode1">Run</button>
                    <button type="button" class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" id="reloadCode1">Reset</button>                    
                </div>

                <p>Quite a complex environment for such a small code sample. We've added actions that remove and add objects
                    from and to containters, change containers state (open/closed) and interact with multiple objects. There
                    are <em>disastrous</em> actions: if Vasiliy tries to use a carton of milk without a cup on a table he'll
                    spill it. We could design this differently - allow all possible actions in the "actions" function and
                    make such that impossible or redundant actions (trying to close an already closed fridge for example)
                    do nothing in "transition" function.
                </p>

                In the most simple case Vasiliy knows everything about the environment, for example, he knows that
