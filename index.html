                    <h3>AI in games</h3>
                    <p>I've always wondered: why NPCs in video games are so dumb?
                    This is one of the top complaints about every other game and a constant source of jokes since my childhood.
                    Off the top of my head I can name only one paper about AI in games - that is about <a href="http://alumni.media.mit.edu/~jorkin/gdc2006_orkin_jeff_fear.pdf">AI</a> 
                    of a shooter game F.E.A.R.
                    More than 10 years have passed, but <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2017/04/03/why-fears-ai-is-still-the-best-in-first-person-shooters/">F.E.A.R.'s AI
                    is still considered the best in FPS</a> by some, and I've never heard about any other game's outstanding AI either. </p>
                    
                    <p class="lead">Is it really hard to code or is it simple, but game design becomes really hard with intelligent NPCs, and they're generally not needed for a good game?</p>
                    <p>
                    There are arguments in support of the latter - for example in horror games like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2010/09/07/wot-i-think-amnesia-the-dark-descent/">Amnesia</a> monsters certainly should not be that clever if at all. 
                    Very simple behavior and a couple of designer tricks are enough to terrify the player and build immersion. 
                    You can exploit player's imagination even without a single "physical" NPC in your simulated world. 
                    A great game surely can be made based on great story, fun gameplay or it can be online - there is no need for intelligent NPCs when you have
                    human characters all around, right? </p>

                    <p>On the other hand, maybe good AI <i>is</i> hard to develop and not so many programmers can actually do it?</p>
                    
                    <p>The field of AI has exploded 5 years ago with 
                       the invention of Deep Learning. Now programmers have myriad of tools to develop automated solutions for problems ranging from visual recognition to self-driving cars.
                       The problem is Deep Learning engineering is still quite hard and programs are still slow requiring massive amount of GPU computation.
                       DL-based AI can, for example, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=947bSUtuSQ0">play Doom</a>, but to get to that point you have to be great
                       neural network engineer and spend many days training your net. My personal acquaintance with DL-based algorithms for intelligent NPCs (DQN and A3C) left me
                       disappointed. They can be unstable even on simplest tasks and prone to bugs that are very hard to find.

                    <hr>
                    <p>So, we ruled out Deep Learning AI in games at least for now, what else do we have? 
                       The good thing is "AI explosion" reignited interest in many related areas and we've got updated knowledge sources and tools on more "classical" algorithms too.
                       Can we build more intelligent NPCs for games using oldschool algorithms given all we now know? It seems F.E.A.R. did and it seems it was not that hard.
                    </p>
                    <p>Here's what we'll do in this blog series - we'll define non-trivial problems for an NPC in a game and try to write programs that help him. 
                       Alas, we don't have any game to work with, but that shouldn't be much of a problem - we'll develop a game world in text on the go. 
                       Writing a text-based RPG must be fun anyway, right?</p>
                    
                    <p>We'll start with the simplest problems and programs and try to get as far as possible. We'll try to build up interesting problems and game designs 
                       and try to use everything on them, <a href="http://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/">AIMA</a> algorithms, <a href="http://agentmodels.org/">probabilistic programming</a>, 
                       maybe we'll find a way to use neural net based Reinforcement Learning too.
